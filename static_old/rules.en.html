<h1 id="helpPage_rulesTitle">Rules</h1>

<p>The game is also known as "Alias" among English-speakers, but the name "Hat" will be used here.</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p class="justify">
Your goal in the Hat game is to explain and guess as many words as you can. In a normal offline game, players use a real hat as a word container. They pull out the words and try to explain them. In the context of the pandemic, it's difficult to meet each other and play Hat. So, we've created this web app to allow you to play remotely.
</p>

<h2>How to start?</h2>
<p class="justify">
At first you have to assemble a team of Hat players. The Hat is a game where you have to communicate a lot. You can use any means of communication or even meet in real life (but only if the quarantine has ended ;). Choose a key which will be used to enter the game. Also, if you feel like being the leader of your team, you can create a room and send its key or link to the others. In this case, you will become the room holder and you will be able to do special things: edit the game settings and start the game.
</p>

<h2>Game round</h2>
<p class="justify">
The main part of the game round is an explanation stage.
<br>
At this stage, two players are chosen as the <b>current pair</b> (speaker and listener) and everyone can see it in advance. As soon as both of them are ready, the speaker will see a <b>word</b>, which they will have to explain to the listener.
<br>
If the word has been explained successfully, the speaker presses the <b>Explained</b> button. The word will be removed from the hat and the current pair gets one point.
<br>
If you have broken a rule while explaining, press the <b>Mistake</b> button. The word will be removed, and the explanation will stop immediately.
<br>
If a word seems too difficult and you don't want to explain it, you can press the <b>Not explained</b> button. The explanation will stop. We don't recommend this, because a good Hat player should fight to the end!!!
<br>
Keep track of <b>time</b>! It is limited, and once it expires, the explanation has to be finished. The listener has only one attempt to guess the last word.
</p>
<h2>Round editing</h2>
<p class="justify">
After the last word has been either guessed or not, the speaker gets an opportunity to edit the results of the round in case they are wrong.
<br>
The next round starts only after the editing stage has been completed.
</p>

<h2>How to explain a word?</h2>
<p class="justify">
You can use your own rules (even pantomime), but there are the rules which we highly <b>recommend</b>:
<li>You can't use cognate words</li>
<li>You can't use non-existent words</li>
<li>You can't talk about the letters of the word (however, you can use terms such as "beginning of the word", suffix, prefix)</li>
<br>
You can find detailed rules there <a href="http://thehat.ru/rules/">http://thehat.ru/rules/</a>
</p>

<h2>Summing up</h2>
<p class="justify">
The game ends as soon as there are no words in the hat. The result of a player is the <b>sum</b> of all the words they have explained and guessed during the game.
