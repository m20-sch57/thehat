<p class="faq-question">
My friend has created a game, how can I join it?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
He should send you its key, and you should paste it in the corresponding field.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
What is the meaning of the words which are used as the room keys?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
These "words" are just random sequences of letters, they don't mean anything. You won't find any of them in the game.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
I've joined a room and I see a "Game is not started" label. How can I start the game?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
You are not the holder of the room, so you can't start the game. The holder of the room is the one who has created it. Only the holder can do it.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
How to enable a voice chat?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
It is not available yet. We assume that you are using some third party service for audio/video communication, such as Zoom, Skype or Discord.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
Why is the round duration equal to 40 seconds? Is it possible to adjust this value?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
During testing, we found that the efficiency of the online explanations is worse, because it's difficult to speak and listen simultaneously. So, we've increased the round duration. It's possible to change it on the game settings page. Only the holder can do it.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
What is the difference between "Not explained" and "Mistake" buttons?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
"Mistake" means that speaker has violated the rules (e. g. said a cognate word). Pressing this button finishes the round and removes the word from the hat. "Not explained" button means that speaker hasn't just managed to explain the word, and the word remains in the hat.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
How to change the number of words in the hat?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
The holder can do it on the game settings page.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
What is the logic behind the pair of speaker/listener choice?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
The players can be arranged in a circle, using their joining order. Then, each player will be explaining words to the next one. After that, everyone will be explaining words to the next of the next player, and so on. Thus, after a while each pair of players will explain words to each other. When it happens, the process will be repeated.
</p>
