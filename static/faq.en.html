<p class="faq-question">
My friend has created a game, how can I join it?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
He should send you a room key, and you should paste it to the corresponding field
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
What is the meaning of the words, which are used as the room keys?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
These "words" are just random sequences of letters, they don't have any meaning. No, you won't find any of them in a hat.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
I've joined a room and I see a "Game not started" label. How can I start the game?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
You are not the host of the game room, so you can't start the game. The host of the room is the one who created it. Only the host can do it.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
How to enable voice chat?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
It is not available yet. We assume that you are using some third party service for audio/video communication, such as Zoom, Skype or Discord.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
Why is the round length equal to 40 seconds? Is it possible to adjust this value?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
During testing, we found that the efficiency of the online explanations is worse, because it's difficult to speak and listen simultaneously. So, we've increased the round duration. It's possible to change it in the game settings. Only the host can do it.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
What is the difference between the "Not explained" and "Mistake" buttons?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
"Mistake" means that the speaker has violated the rules (e. g. said a cognate word). Pressing this button finishes the round and removes the word from the hat. "Not explained" button means that the speaker just didn't manage to explain the word, and the word stays in the hat.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
How to change the number of words in the hat?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
The host can do it, using game settings.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
What is the logic behind the pair of speaker/listener choice?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
The players can be arranged in a circle, using their joining order. Then, each player will be explaining words to the next one. After it, everyone will be explaining words to the next of the next player, and so on. Thus, after a while each pair of players will explain words to each other. When it happens, the process will be repeated.
</p>

<p class="faq-answer">
Not yet, but thiss feature will be implemented soon.
