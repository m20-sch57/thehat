<p class="faq-question">
My friend has created a game, how do I join it?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
They should send you the game key, so you can paste it in the corresponding field.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
What is the meaning of the words which are used as room keys?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
These "words" are just random letter sequences, they don't mean anything. You won't find any of them in the game.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
I've joined a room and I see the label "Game is not started". How can I start the game?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
You are not the room holder, so you can't start the game. The room holder is the person who created it. Only they can do it.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
How do I enable a voice chat?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
This feature is not available yet. We assume that you are using some third-party service for audio/video communication, such as Zoom, Skype or Discord.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
Why is the round duration 40 seconds? Is it possible to adjust this?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
During testing, we found that the efficiency of online explanations is worse, because it's difficult to speak and listen simultaneously. So, we've changed the round duration from 20 to 40. It's possible to change it on the game settings page. Only the holder can do it.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
What is the difference between the buttons "Not explained" and "Mistake"?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
"Mistake" means that the speaker has broken the rules (e. g. said a cognate word). Pressing this button finishes the round and removes the word from the hat. "Not explained" means that the speaker hasn't managed to explain the word, and the word remains in the hat.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
How do I change the number of words in the hat?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
The holder can do this on the game settings page.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
What is the logic behind the speaker/listener pair choice?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
We virtually arrange the players in a circle by their joining order. In the first round, each player explains words to their first neighbour on the left. In the second round, everyone explains words to the next person on the left skipping one, and so on. Thus, after a while, each pair of players will have explained words to each other. When this happens, the process will be repeated.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
Is it possible to play in pairs?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
Not yet, but this feature will be implemented soon.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
When does the game end?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
When all the words in the hat are explained. The room host can also finish the game by pressing the button with flag.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
Is it possible to play a particular number of rounds?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
Yes, the holder can choose this option on the game settings page.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
Where do the words come from?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
Russian words are taken from Sombrero API, English words are taken from <a href="https://github.com/hugsy/stuff/blob/master/random-word/english-nouns.txt">this</a> repository.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
I accidentally closed the game tab. What should I do?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
Just enter the game room by typing in its key and your name.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
What is the difference between this Hat app and other ones?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
Unlike other apps, you can play Hat with this app remotely, for example, staying at home.
</p>

<p class="faq-question">
I don't like the sound. How can I turn it off?
</p>
<p class="faq-answer">
It can be done on the game page.
