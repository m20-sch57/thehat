<h2>General</h2>
<p class="justify">
Your objective in the hat game &ndash; explain as much words as you can. Usually players use a real hat as a word container. They pull words from it and try to explain them. In the context of the pandemic, it's difficult to get together and play hat. So, we've created a web app, which you can use to play the hat game, staying at home.
</p>

<h2>How to start?</h2>
<p class="justify">
At first you have to put together a group of hat players. The hat is a game, where you have to communicate a lot. You can use any kind of communication or even meet in real life (but only if the quarantine has ended ;). Choose a key, which will be used for entering the game. Also, some of you can create a room and send its key or link to others. The first one to enter will get an important role to start the game when everyone logs in.
</p>

<h2>Game round</h2>
<p class="justify">
The main part of the game round is explanation stage.
<br>
Two players will be chosen as a <b>current pair</b>, everyone will see it in advance.
When both of the players are ready, one of them will be shown a <b>word</b>, which he need to <b>explain</b> to the parthner.
<br>
If the word has been explained successfully, you should press the <b>Explained</b> button. The word will be removed from the hat, and the current pair will get one point.
<br>
If you have violated one of the rules, you should press <b>Mistake</b> button. The word will be removed too, and the explanation will immidiately stop.
<br>
If the word turned out to be difficult, and it's clear, that you won't be able to explain it, you can press the <b>Give up</b> button. We don't advise you to do it, because good hat player will try to explain the word to the end.
<br>
Keep in mind <b>time</b>. It is limited, and when it expires, the explanation must be finished. The listener will get a one attempt to guess the last word.
</p>
<h2>Round editing</h2>
<p class="justify">
When the last word is either guessed or not, the speaker will have an opportunity to edit the results of the round in case of their incorrectness.
<br>
When the editing phase is finished, the next round starts.
</p>

<h2>How to explain a word?</h2>
<p class="justify">
You can fix the rules by yourself (even use pantomime), but here is the list of rules we <b>recommend</b>:
<li>You can't use congate words</li>
<li>You can't use words, that do not exist</li>
<li>You can't use the letters of the word (however, you can use terms such as "beginning of the word")</li>
<br>
You can find detailed rules there <a href="http://thehat.ru/rules/">http://thehat.ru/rules/</a>
</p>

<h2>Results calculation</h2>
<p class="justify">
The game ends as soon as there are no any more words in the hat. The result of a player is the <b>sum</b> explained and guessed words.
